## What is SESHAT?

**SESHAT** is an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that provides **intellectual property protection** through blockchain attestations. Named after the ancient Egyptian goddess of writing, wisdom, and record-keeping, SESHAT creates immutable proof of your creative work.

## Why SESHAT?

Traditional IP protection relies on trust:
- Filing dates that can be disputed
- Centralized registries that can be compromised
- Paper trails that can be lost

SESHAT creates **cryptographic proof** anchored on **Base L2** blockchain:
- **Immutable**: Once attested, proof cannot be altered
- **Timestamped**: Blockchain provides authoritative timestamps
- **Verifiable**: Anyone can verify attestations on EAS
- **Sovereign**: You control your proof chain

## The Proof Chain

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Research Notes] --> B[SHA-512 Hash]
    C[Git Commits] --> B
    D[PRs & Tags] --> B
    B --> E[EAS Attestation]
    E --> F[Base L2 Blockchain]
    F --> G[Immutable Proof]
```

Every piece of work is:
1. **Hashed** with SHA-512 for unique fingerprinting
2. **Attested** via EAS (Ethereum Attestation Service)
3. **Anchored** on Base L2 (low-cost, high-speed)
4. **Recorded** in your local SQLite ledger
