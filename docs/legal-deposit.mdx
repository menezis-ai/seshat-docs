## What is Legal Deposit?

Legal deposit is the process of registering your creative work with an official authority to establish copyright. SESHAT generates bundles that meet the requirements of most copyright registration services.

### PROOF_CHAIN.json
All attestation UIDs forming the proof chain, with Merkle root linking everything together.

### MANIFEST.json

## Legal Considerations

<Warning>
  SESHAT provides **evidence of creation**, not legal advice. Consult an IP attorney for specific legal questions.
</Warning>

The blockchain attestations prove:
- **When** content existed (timestamp)
- **What** the content was (fingerprint)
- **Who** attested it (wallet address)

They do **not** prove:
- Originality (that you created it first)
- Ownership (that you have rights)
- Validity (that it's legally protectable)

<Tip>
  Combine SESHAT with traditional copyright registration for maximum protection.
