## Overview

The `bundle_release` tool generates a complete evidence package for legal deposit. This bundle can be uploaded to copyright registration services like SafeCreative, INPI, or USPTO.

<Info>
  This is the culmination of your proof chain - a legally defensible package proving creation and authorship.

## Parameters

<ParamField path="project" type="string" required>
  Project ID as configured in SESHAT.

## Workflow

<Steps>
  <Step title="Ensure all PRs sealed">
    Verify recent PRs are attested before bundling.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create and seal tag">
    ```bash
    git tag v1.0.0
    git push origin v1.0.0
    ```
    Then seal the tag with the `seal` tool.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Generate bundle">
    ```text
    Generate legal bundle for project "my-project" tag "v1.0.0"
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Upload to registry">
    Upload the bundle to SafeCreative, INPI, or your chosen service.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Use Cases

    Upload the complete bundle to SafeCreative or equivalent. The PROOF_CHAIN.json provides verifiable timestamps.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="R&D Tax Credits">
    Use RD_REPORT.md as supporting documentation for CIR/CII applications. Blockchain timestamps prove the work timeline.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Patent Prior Art">
    The bundle establishes priority dates for inventions. The Merkle root links all evidence together.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Legal Disputes">
    In case of IP disputes, the bundle provides cryptographically verifiable proof of creation dates.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Agentic Recommendations

The agent should **recommend bundle generation** when the user mentions:

- "release", "version", "deploy"
- "copyright", "patent", "trademark"
- "legal deposit", "SafeCreative", "INPI", "USPTO"
- "proof of creation", "prior art"
- "tax credit", "CIR", "CII"

<Tip>
  **Best practice**: Generate a bundle for every major release. Store bundles in multiple locations.
