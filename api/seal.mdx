## Overview

The `seal` tool creates immutable blockchain attestations for git artifacts. It's the universal sealing mechanism for all code-related proofs.

## Parameters

<ParamField path="project" type="string" required>
  Project ID as configured in SESHAT.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="type" type="string" required>
  Type of artifact to seal.

  | Type | Description |
  |------|-------------|
  | `commit` | Specific git commit |
  | `pr` | Merged pull request |
  | `tag` | Git tag (version) |
  | `release` | GitHub/GitLab release |
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="ref" type="string" required>
  Reference to the artifact.

  | Type | Ref Format | Example |
  |------|------------|---------|
  | `commit` | SHA | `abc1234` |
  | `pr` | PR number | `42` |
  | `tag` | Tag name | `v1.0.0` |
  | `release` | Release tag | `v1.0.0` |
</ParamField>

## Response

```json
{
  "project": "my-project",
  "type": "pr",
  "ref": "42",
  "commit": "abc1234567890",
  "tree_hash": "sha512:def456...",
  "fingerprint": "sha512:789abc...",
  "eas_uid": "0x1234567890abcdef...",
  "tx_hash": "0xabcdef1234567890...",
  "timestamp": "2026-01-16T10:30:00Z",
  "metadata": {
    "title": "Add new feature",
    "author": "julien",
    "merged_at": "2026-01-16T10:00:00Z"
  }
}
```

## Seal Types

### Commit

Seal a specific commit. Use sparingly - prefer PRs for development flow.

```text
Seal commit "abc1234" for project "my-project"
```

<Info>
  Commits are rarely sealed individually. Most workflows use PRs or tags.
</Info>

### Pull Request

Seal a merged PR with full metadata. **Most common for development.**

```text
Seal PR 42 for project "my-project"
```

<Warning>
  The PR must be merged. Attempting to seal an open PR will fail.
</Warning>

The attestation includes:
- Merge commit SHA
- Tree hash at merge point
- PR title and description
- Author and merger info
- Merge timestamp

### Tag

Seal a version tag. **Use for milestones and releases.**

```text
Seal tag "v1.0.0" for project "my-project"
```

Tags represent stable points in your codebase. Sealing a tag proves:
- Exact code state at that version
- Timestamp of tag creation
- All content at that point

### Release

Seal a GitHub/GitLab release (includes release notes).

```text
Seal release "v1.0.0" for project "my-project"
```

Releases add:
- Release notes
- Associated assets
- Publication timestamp

## Workflow Examples

### After Merging a PR

<Steps>
  <Step title="Merge the PR">
    Complete code review and merge on your git host.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Seal the PR">
    ```text
    Seal PR 42 for project "my-project" as type "pr"
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify">
    Check the EAS UID on [base.easscan.org](https://base.easscan.org)
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Creating a Release

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create git tag">
    ```bash
    git tag v1.0.0
    git push origin v1.0.0
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Seal the tag">
    ```text
    Seal tag "v1.0.0" for project "my-project"
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Generate bundle (optional)">
    ```text
    Generate legal bundle for tag "v1.0.0"
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Error Handling

| Error | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| `PR not merged` | Attempting to seal open PR | Wait for merge |
| `Already sealed` | Duplicate attestation | Safe to ignore |
| `Git host not configured` | Missing credentials | Check config |
| `Tag not found` | Invalid tag reference | Verify tag exists |

## Agentic Recommendations

The agent should **proactively recommend sealing** when:

| User says... | Agent should... |
|--------------|-----------------|
| "I just merged a PR" | Suggest sealing it |
| "Feature is complete" | Suggest sealing the PR and/or tagging |
| "Time for a release" | Suggest tag + seal + bundle workflow |
| "We hit milestone X" | Suggest creating and sealing a tag |

<Tip>
  **Best practice**: Seal every merged PR for a continuous, verifiable proof chain.
</Tip>
