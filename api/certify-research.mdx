description: 'Certify Obsidian research notes on blockchain'
api: 'MCP certify_research'

## Overview

The `certify_research` tool scans your Obsidian vault for research notes and anchors them on the blockchain. Each note is hashed with SHA-512 and attested via EAS on Base L2.

<Info>
  This tool is essential for R&D tax credits (CIR/CII). It provides timestamped proof of research hours.
</Info>

## Parameters

<ParamField path="project" type="string" required>
  Project ID to certify notes for. Must match the `project` field in note frontmatter.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="since" type="string" default="7 days ago">
  ISO date string. Only certify notes modified after this date.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="dry_run" type="boolean" default="false">
  If `true`, preview what would be certified without creating attestations.

  <Tip>
    **Always use `dry_run: true` first** to review before committing to blockchain.
  </Tip>
</ParamField>

## Obsidian Note Format

Notes must have YAML frontmatter with these required fields:

```yaml
---
project: my-project      # Must match the project parameter
date: 2026-01-16         # Research date
hours: 2.5               # Effort in hours
class: S                 # S=Strategic, A=Advanced, C=Common
status: reviewed         # Must NOT be "draft"
---

# Research Content

```

### Class Levels

| Class | Description | Tax Credit Multiplier |
|-------|-------------|----------------------|
| **S** | Strategic - Novel research, breakthrough | Highest |
| **A** | Advanced - Complex problem solving | Medium |
| **C** | Common - Standard development | Base |

<Warning>
  Notes with `status: draft` are automatically skipped. Change to `reviewed` when ready to certify.
</Warning>

## Response

```json
{
  "project": "my-project",
  "certified": 5,
  "skipped": 2,
  "total_hours": 12.5,
  "notes": [
    {
      "file": "research/2026-01-16-feature-analysis.md",
      "fingerprint": "sha512:abc123...",
      "hours": 2.5,
      "class": "S",
      "eas_uid": "0x1234...",
      "tx_hash": "0xabcd..."
    }
  ],
  "skipped_notes": [
    {
      "file": "research/draft-idea.md",
      "reason": "status is draft"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Workflow

<Steps>
  <Step title="Preview with dry_run">
    ```text
    Certify research for project "my-project" with dry_run enabled
    ```

    Review the list of notes that will be certified.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Check Hours">
    Verify `total_hours` is reasonable. Flag if > 40h/week.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Certify">
    ```text
    Certify research for project "my-project"
    ```

    Remove `dry_run` to create actual attestations.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify">
    Check the returned `eas_uid` values on [base.easscan.org](https://base.easscan.org)
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Examples

### Preview Certification

<CodeGroup>
```text MCP Prompt
Certify research notes for project "seshat" since 2026-01-01 with dry_run enabled
```

```json Response
{
  "project": "seshat",
  "certified": 0,
  "would_certify": 8,
  "total_hours": 24.5,
  "dry_run": true,
  "notes": [
    {
      "file": "research/mcp-architecture.md",
      "hours": 4,
      "class": "S",
      "status": "would_certify"
    }
  ]
}
```
</CodeGroup>

### Actual Certification

<CodeGroup>
```text MCP Prompt
Certify research notes for project "seshat"
```

```json Response
{
  "project": "seshat",
  "certified": 8,
  "total_hours": 24.5,
  "notes": [
    {
      "file": "research/mcp-architecture.md",
      "fingerprint": "sha512:e3b0c44298fc1c149afbf4c8...",
      "eas_uid": "0x1234567890abcdef...",
      "tx_hash": "0xabcdef1234567890..."
    }
  ]
}
```
</CodeGroup>

## Warnings

<Warning>
  **High hours**: If `total_hours` > 40 per week, the agent should flag this as unusually high.
</Warning>

<Warning>
  **Missing frontmatter**: Notes without required frontmatter fields are skipped with an error reason.
</Warning>

<Warning>
  **Already certified**: Notes with the same fingerprint are skipped (duplicate protection).
</Warning>

## Best Practices

1. **Certify weekly** to maintain a continuous proof chain
2. **Use meaningful class levels** - S for breakthroughs, C for routine work
3. **Keep detailed notes** - they're part of your legal evidence
4. **Review before certifying** - `dry_run` is your friend
